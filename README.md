# Dynamic peg
This features a demo of the dynamic peg working live on testnet. It has the ability to drop it's own supply while remembering what was set aside.
It is extremely advanced far beyond any currency developed in the industry. Also it uses various techniques to detect how a user is interacting with decentralized AMM exchanges and a custom router. This code may be run natively from the desktop by running pythonserver.bat with the latest version of python installed so the page may run locally.
